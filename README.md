Answers to the questions of the json in Jorge's repo and the script to send a POST to a given host
# Instructions
* The script uses the json and requests libraries which are a default after python 2.7.5 so there is no need to install them.
* The script needs an URL that has to be introduced by the user in the location he wants the json info to be stored
* The script outputs the json that was posted, if you want to see it "pretty" write the command like this "python send_answers.py | python -m json.tool"
